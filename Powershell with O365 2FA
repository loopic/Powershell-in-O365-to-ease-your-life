Because of the 2 factor authentication, O365 modules in powershell need to be imported every time a new powershell session is started.

There is no easy way of storing the credentials since the use of a one-time password prevents it.

After playing around with the different methods of importing and saving modules in powershell with my 2 factor authentication, I have come to the conclusion that I will have no choice for the modules to work than to insert my credentials & 1 time password manually every time that I want to add a module in my powershell session.

For the sake of "simplicity" when first opening poweshell and loading my start-up profile, I've decided to connect all the modules necessary for the management of Office 365 Services at once.

This equals to me having to confirm my credentials 


1 - Local Admin credentials to run Powershell with high privileges;
2 - O365 Global Admin Credentials + one-time pass to start a new Exchange Online Powershell Session;
3 - O365 Global Admin Credentials + one-time pass to connect to MS online services;
4 - O365 Global Admin Credentials + one-time pass to connect to AzureAD services;
5* - O365 Global Admin Credentials + one-time pass to connect to ExchangeOnline services;

5* Prior to the connection to ExchangeOnline, you need to install the new module Exchange Online Powershell V2 with the command:
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement

A copy of my Powershell profile script will be available in this repository.
